# D7 - Functions and Methods

**Methods** in a Vue instance behave like normal JavaScript functions and are evaluated only when explicitly called. 

```
Methods are functions that mutate state and trigger updates.// They can be bound as event listeners in templates.
```

```jsx
<script>
export default {
  // Properties returned from data() become reactive state
  // and will be exposed on `this`.
  data() {
    return {
      count: 0
    }
  },

  // Methods are functions that mutate state and trigger updates.
  // They can be bound as event listeners in templates.
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.count++
    }
  },

  // Lifecycle hooks are called at different stages
  // of a component's lifecycle.
  // This function will be called when the component is mounted.
  mounted() {
    console.log(`The initial count is ${this.count}.`)
  }
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
</template>
```

## Functions - Composition api

They behave like normal JavaScript functions and are evaluated only when explicitly called. Functions that mutate state and trigger updates.

```jsx
<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'

// reactive state
const count = ref(0)

// functions that mutate state and trigger updates
function increment() {
  count.value++
}

// lifecycle hooks
onMounted(() => {
  console.log(`The initial count is ${count.value}.`)
})
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
</template>
```

## Computed properties
**Computed Property in Vue3 is used to declaratively describe a value that is dependent on other values**. This feature of VueJS allows for **transformations** or **computations** based on our data. We can reuse the result of these computations and transformations in our DOM template.

**Computed properties remove the need for complex in-template expressions**.

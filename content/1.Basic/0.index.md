# Introduction to Vue 3

Vue is an open-source JavaScript framework geared toward building user interfaces, created by **[Evan You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi?lang=en)**. If we take a glance at the **[front page of the main website](https://vuejs.org/)**, we can see that Vue is said to be the progressive JavaScript framework that is **approachable**, **versatile**, and **performant**. Let’s explain each of these points:

### **Progressive**

It is recognized to be **progressive** since it can often be scaled down as well as it scales up. For very simple use cases, you can use **Vue** like you use *jQuery* - by dropping a single script tag:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3"></script> 
```

### **Approachable**

Builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with intuitive API and world-class documentation.

### **Performant**

Truly reactive, compiler-optimized rendering system that rarely requires manual optimization.

### **Versatile**

A rich, incrementally adoptable ecosystem that scales between a library and a full-featured framework.

### Features

- The **[vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/)** (i.e. Vue Command Line Interface) allows for rapid prototyping and set-up of Vue-Webpack applications.
- **[vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/)** which helps us introduce client-side routing into our application with relative ease.
- **[vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/)**, the Elm-inspired Flux-like library that helps facilitate how data is managed in an application.
- **[pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)**, Stores are as familiar as components. API is designed to let you write well-organized stores.
- **[vue-test-utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/)**, the testing utility library that introduces various helpers and function to make testing Vue components a lot easier.

## How to use VueJs - Install Vue3

Depending on your use case and preference, you can use Vue with or without a build step.

### Without Build Tools

To get started with Vue without a build step, simply copy the following code into an HTML file and open it in your browser:

``` html
<!-- don't need nodejs -->

<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3"></script>

<div id="app">{{ message }}</div>

<script>
  const { createApp } = Vue

  createApp({
    data() {
      return {
        message: 'Hello Vue!'
      }
    }
  }).mount('#app')
</script>

```

Wow, you just run Hello World, a program in Vue. Bravo.

### **With Build Tools**

A build setup allows us to use Vue **[Single-File Components](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc.html)** (SFCs). The official Vue build setup is based on **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**, a front-end build tool that is modern, lightweight, and extremely fast.

**Online**

You can try Vue with SFC online on **[StackBlitz](https://vite.new/vue)**. StackBlitz runs the Vite-based build setup directly in the browser,

**Local**

Pre-requisites

- Familiarity with the command line
- Install **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**

In the terminal run this

```
npm init vue@latest
```

This command will install and execute **[create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue)**, the official Vue project scaffolding tool. You will see some options. Select them as per project requirements.

```sh
✔ Project name: … <your-project-name>
✔ Add TypeScript? … No / Yes
✔ Add JSX Support? … No / Yes
✔ Add Vue Router for Single Page Application development? … No / Yes
✔ Add Pinia for state management? … No / Yes
✔ Add Vitest for Unit testing? … No / Yes
✔ Add Cypress for both Unit and End-to-End testing? … No / Yes
✔ Add ESLint for code quality? … No / Yes
✔ Add Prettier for code formatting? … No / Yes

Scaffolding project in ./<your-project-name>...
Done.

```

then

```sh
cd <your-project-name>
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should now have your first Vue project running! Enjoy

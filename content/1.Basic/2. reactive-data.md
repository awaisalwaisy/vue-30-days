# D3 - Handle reactivity in Vue3

*Reactivity is the ability for a variable (array, string, number, object, etc) to update when its value or any other variable that it makes reference to is changed after declaration.* 

By default, **JavaScript isn’t reactive.** It means that if we create the variable `boy` and reference it in part A of our application, then proceed to modify `boy` in part B, part A will not update with the new value of `boy`.

```jsx
let framework = 'Vue';
let sentence = `${framework} is awesome`;
console.log(sentence)
 // logs "Vue is awesome"
framework = 'React';
console.log(sentence)
//should log "React is awesome" if 'sentence' is reactive.
```

**Another example ⇒** Let’s take **[a simple Markdown editor](https://v3.vuejs.org/examples/markdown.html)**
 as an example. It usually has two panes: one for writing the Markdown code (which modifies the underlying model), and one for previewing the compiled HTML (which shows the updated view).

# Reactivity in Vue:

In Vue 2.x, `props` , `computed` , and `data()` were all reactive by default, with the exception of properties that are not present in `data` when such components are created. Vue 2 and option api uses `Vue.observable()` to make values reactive. 

## Reactivity in Vue 3:

In Vue `reactive` method, is the equivalent of `Vue.observable()` in Vue 2.6. But new reactive system is based on ES6 proxy and Reflect api. To understand behind the scene of Vue 3 reactivity, you should learn the proxy concept. 

### What is JavaScript proxy

check here, how proxy work in JavaScript with reflect api. 

```jsx
let person = {
  name: "David",
  age: 27
};

const handler = {
  get(target, property, receiver) {
    // track(target, property)
    console.log(property) // output: name
    return Reflect.get(target, property, receiver)
  },
  set(target, property, value, receiver) {
    // trigger(target, property)
    console.log(`${property}: ${value}`) // output: "age: 30" and "hobby: Programming"
    return Reflect.set(target, property, value, receiver)
  }
}

let proxy = new Proxy(person, handler);   

console.log(person)

// get (reading a property value)
console.log(proxy.name)  // output: David

// set (writing to a property)
proxy.age = 30;

// set (creating a new property)
proxy.hobby = "Programming";

console.log(person)
```

here is the live version ⇒ [https://jsbin.com/qetivalezi/edit?js,console](https://jsbin.com/qetivalezi/edit?js,console)

The `get` and `set` traps take the following arguments:

- `target`: the target object which is wrapped by the proxy
- `property`: the property name
- `value`: the property value (this argument is used only for set operations)
- `receiver`: the object on which the operation takes place (usually the proxy)

The Reflect API methods accepts the same arguments as their corresponding proxy methods.

## ****Vue 3 Reactivity Model****

There are some basic methods to controll data reactivity: 

- `ref` takes a primitive value or a plain object and returns a reactive and mutable ref object. The ref object has only one property `value` that points to the primitive value or the plain object.
- `reactive` takes an object and returns a reactive copy of the object. The conversion is deep and affects all nested properties.
- `readonly` takes a ref or an object (plain or reactive) and returns a readonly object to the original. The conversion is deep and affects all nested properties.
- `markRaw` returns the object itself and prevents it from being converted to a proxy object.

### ref

Takes an inner value and returns a reactive and mutable ref object, which has a single property `.value` that points to the inner value.

```jsx
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const msg = ref('Hello World!')
</script>

<template>
  <h1>{{ msg }}</h1>
  <input v-model="msg">
</template>
```

### reactive

Reactive objects are **[JavaScript Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)** and behave just like normal objects. The difference is that Vue is able to track the property access and mutations of a reactive object.

```jsx
<script setup>
import { reactive } from 'vue'

const state = reactive({ count: 0 })

function increment() {
  state.count++
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">
    {{ state.count }}
  </button>
</template>
```
